# Notes
- Intention over implementation
- Abstract function first locally then deal with passing in the variables but first slide statement to have logic close to each other.

## Naming conventions
- enhanceXX
- aXX for a single entity
- renderXX for displaying
- THINGFor ie amountFor(aperformance)

## How to reduce args and improve intention 
- make data structure
- enrich a known data structure
- replace temp with query
- slide statement into the funtion 


## Top Ten Refactoriings
1. Extract Function
2. Replace temp with query
3. Split phase
4. Inline variable
5. Change function declaration 
6. Slide statements
7. Split loop
8. Replace loop with pipeline


## Check list
- can I make the names show more intention
- have Itested the unhappy path
- have I typed everything
- are my functions pure
- consider the design stamina hypothesis and is it faster
- I am alwasy trying to learn to code faster which means refactoring and testing
